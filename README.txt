1. Where to store the database connection credentials.

	
   We are in this program using a different file named dbconnect_pdo.php to connect to the database. And the database connection credentials are supposed to be stored in there.

2. What if I want a better and more advanced form to query the result.

   Well if you want to do so you wont have to do any work on the php or mysql part of the code. All you have to do is design the new form and then bring together the input parameters to create a new qry string. And also make sure that the new qry string is properly communicated with the code.

3. Can I use mysql_connect instead of PDO.

   Well then I believe you probably should not use this template. This template is for those who are using PDO. And PDO is also more safegaurded against run-time bugs. Integrating PDO functions with a try catch encapsulation can be useful when you are dealing with strong bounds and boundries. I would suggest you to do more reading on PDO function and the PHP try and catch if you are interested in doing something like that. 	

4. What is the PHP_GnuPlot.php?

   As you may have seem it is the package used to plot graphs on this
interface. It is a simple plugin written by Liu Yi (Eric) <eric.liu.yi (at) gmail.com> as a interface between the data generated by the interface from our model database on dbprode to the gnuplot libraries thus enabling the plotting of these data.
